# Contributing

Contributions of any kind are welcome, be it bug fixes, version updates, or typo corrections. 

### Issues

If you run into a problem while using the library - weird behavior, bug, missing API - you can submit your problem as a [new issue](https://github.com/zsmb13/MaterialDrawerKt/issues/new). However, please check if there are any [previous issues](https://github.com/zsmb13/MaterialDrawerKt/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue) addressing the same problem.

### Pull requests

If you can fix the problems that you find yourself, you're welcome to create pull requests as well.

Some general rules regarding these:

- Create them against the `dev` branch.
- Describe the nature of the changes you've made as best you can.
- Be very careful about changing public API.
